          "**Summary of 'Gradient Descent Explained – Step by Step':**\\n\\n**Overview:**\\nGradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a function by iteratively moving towards the minimum value of the function.\\n\\n**Key Points:**\\n- It starts with an initial guess and updates it by taking steps proportional to the negative of the gradient.\\n- Learning rate controls the step size — too high overshoots, too low makes it slow.\\n- Used widely in linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks.\\n\\n**Equation Used:**\\nθ = θ - α * ∇J(θ)\\n\\n**Timestamp Highlights:**\\n- 01:45 – Explanation of Cost Function\\n- 03:22 – Derivation of Gradient\\n- 05:10 – Learning Rate Visualization\\n\\nLet me know if you'd like a markdown export!"
